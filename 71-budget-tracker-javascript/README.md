# JavaScript Budget Tracker

## Project Brief

Create a budget tracker application using JavaScript that enables users to manage their income and expenses efficiently. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting financial transactions, as well as display a summary of their budget.

## Key Features

1. **Transaction Management:**
   - Users can add new income and expense transactions.
   - Each transaction should include details such as the amount, category, and date.
   - Users can edit or delete existing transactions.

2. **Budget Calculation:**
   - The application should calculate and display the user's current balance based on their income and expenses.
   - Users should be able to view a breakdown of their transactions by category.

3. **Date Filtering:**
   - Allow users to filter transactions based on a specific date range.
   - Implement default views like monthly or yearly summaries.

4. **Visual Representation:**
   - Use charts or graphs to visually represent the distribution of income and expenses.
   - Provide a clear visual overview of the budget balance over time.

5. **Persistence:**
   - Implement local storage to save user transactions and preferences, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

6. **User Authentication (Optional):**
   - If desired, implement a simple user authentication system to allow multiple users to have individual budget trackers.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Frontend:**
   - Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
   - Consider using a responsive design to ensure usability on various devices.

2. **Backend (Optional):**
   - For data storage and retrieval, you can implement a backend using Node.js, Express, and a simple database (e.g., MongoDB).

3. **External Libraries:**
   - Explore the use of external libraries like Chart.js for visual representations and moment.js for date manipulation.

4. **Security:**
   - If implementing user authentication, prioritize security measures to protect user data.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency in DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
- Practice working with local storage to maintain application state.
- Develop skills in handling user input and form validation.
- Implement basic data visualization for improved user experience.

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional budget tracker application that allows users to manage their finances efficiently, providing a clear overview of income, expenses, and the overall budget status.

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while incorporating practical aspects like data management and user interface design.
