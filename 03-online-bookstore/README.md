# Project Brief
## Level: Intermediate
Create an online Bookstore Web App.
## Introduction
This project aims to create an online bookstore web app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Or a Javacript framework of your choice). 
The website should have the following functionalities:
- Displaying available books with their details (title, author, price) on the homepage.
- Allow users to add books to their shopping cart when they click "Add to Cart" button
next to each book's image or title.
- Provide options for users to view their shopping cart where they can see all the added books and remove any of them if needed.
- Implement search functionality that allows users to find specific books by typing in
their titles or authors.
- Sort books based on different criteria such as price (ascending/descending), title
(alphabetically), author name (alphabetically).
The website should be designed with user-friendly interface and responsive design principles. It is recommended to use a framework like ReactJS or AngularJS for implementing this project.

## Deliverables
1. A detailed README file explaining the purpose of the project, how it works, and
instructions for running the codebase. This document will also include screenshots of
different pages of the application demonstrating its functionality.
2. An HTML file containing the structure of the web page including head, body, and necessary elements such as navigation bar, main content area, footer etc.
3. A CSS file containing the styling rules for the web page. The CSS file should follow
responsive design principles ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
4. A JavaScript file containing the logic for handling user interactions such as adding
to cart, removing from cart, searching books, sorting books etc.
5. A server side script written in Node.js which serves the static files generated by the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This script should handle requests for the various pages of the application and return the appropriate response.
6. Documentation of the API endpoints provided by the server-side script. Each endpoint
should be documented along with examples of how to make HTTP requests to access them.
7. Screenshots of the application showing the implemented features working correctly. These images should demonstrate the applicationâ€™s ability to display books, allow users to add/remove books from their carts, perform searches, sort books, and showcase the overall user experience.
